"If developers are unable to design software to fully exploit the resources provided by multiple cores, then they will ultimately reach an insurmountable performance ceiling." http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-core_(computing)

** ➜ Java concurrency and parallelism, a brief history
   - Visionary and prescient.
   - Built-in support for threads, locks,etc.
   - But too low level, hard to use! (notfifyAll, etc.)
   - D Lea's java.util.concurrent helped a lot.
   - But still too low level!
   - Probably same for forthcoming F/J
   - Java enables // programming but..
   - Difficult to use abstractions
** ➜ Clojure and its concurrency primitives
   - Built on top of Doug Lea's work
   - agents
   - pmap
   - pcalls
   - pvalues
   - futures
** ➜ Agents
   - Agents manage state (also refs & atoms)
   - More importantly managing execution flow
   - send and send-off
   - Examples
** ➜ pmap
   - uses futures under the hood
   - Examples
** ➜ Thinking parallel
   - Clojure solved many problems
   - Must now reason about // programming
   - Watch out for serial bottle necks!
** ➜ Check web cams exercise
